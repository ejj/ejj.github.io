I've been fortunate to work with some talented undergraduates in my
time at UC Berkeley.  We've got a strong, highly collaborative group, focused
on developing high quality software with a solid research foundation.  If
you are an undergraduate at Berkeley that is interested in Computer Networks
or Distributed Systems, send me an email!
