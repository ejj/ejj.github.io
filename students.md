I've been fortunate to work with some talented undergraduates here at UC
Berkeley.  We've got a strong, collaborative group, focused on developing high
quality software with a solid research foundation.  If you are an undergraduate
at Berkeley, interested in Computer Networks or Distributed Systems, send me an
email!
